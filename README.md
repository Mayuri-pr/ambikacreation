## Test your code with the Local Editor
The Local Editor allows you test changes made to your site in real time. The code in your local IDE is synced with the Local Editor, so you can test your changes before committing them to your repo. You can also change the site design in the Local Editor and sync it with your IDE.

Start the Local Editor by navigating to this repo's directory in your terminal and running `wix dev`.

For more information, see [Working with the Local Editor](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-working-with-the-local-editor-beta).

## Preview and publish with the Wix CLI
The Wix CLI is a tool that allows you to work with your site locally from your computer's terminal. You can use it to build a preview version of your site and publish it. You can also use the CLI to install [approved npm packages](https://support.wix.com/en/article/velo-working-with-npm-packages) to your site.

## Invite contributors to work with you
Git Integration & Wix CLI extends Editor X's [concurrent editing](https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-x-about-concurrent-editing) capabilities. Invite other developers as collaborators on your [site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/inviting-people-to-contribute-to-your-site) and your [GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). Multiple developers can work on a site's code at once.
